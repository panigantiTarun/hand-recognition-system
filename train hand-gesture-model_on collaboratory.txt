
step 0 :
        collect the dataset for training custom model
         create a folder with train_data name within the folder create another two folders 1.images
                                                                                           2.labels
         0.1 now in images folder split the images into training(with 80% of imsges) and validation(with 20% of images)
         0.2 label the images with labelimg exe file and split the labeled files into train(80%) and validation(20%). 

         0.3 upload the train_data.zip file into the coolaboratory 



step 1 : 
         !git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone
         %cd yolov5
         %pip install -qr requirements.txt comet_ml  # install

         import torch
         import utils
         display = utils.notebook_init()  # checks

step 2 :
        %cd data
         #here download the coco128.yaml file and modify the file according to your requirement like
           in my case;
                      train: ../train_data/images/train/  
                      val: ../train_data/images/val/  
                      # Classes
                      names:
                          0: Hii
                          1: I lov U
                          2: I
                          3: ok
                          4: super
        after modification upload the file within the same folder.


step 3 :
       !python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 3 --data coco128.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --cache



      after training of the model you will get weights file [ best.pt and last.pt ]
      use these weights in teh code.
