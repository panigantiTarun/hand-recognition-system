# hand-recognition-system
Hand gesture recognition is one of the active research areas in the field of human-computer interface due to its
flexibility and user friendliness. The gesture recognition technique is used to develop a system that can be used 
to convey information among disabled people or for controlling a device. Major challenges for the development of an 
efficient hand gesture recognition technique are illumination variation, nonuniform backgrounds, diversities in the 
size and shape of a user's hand, and high interclass similarities between hand gesture poses. in this project i have 
used yolov5 algorithm which has best efficiency and accuracy.yolo algorithms are the one of the most efficient 
algorithms in present deep learning algorithms.
